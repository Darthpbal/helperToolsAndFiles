This program is meant to be a functional replacement/improvement on my spreadsheet that uses google docs. fuck google

I'm just going to write the stuff I'd like to implement in this program and stuff already implemented in the spreadsheet to document what I want fromt he program once I actually feel like coding it up.



TODO:
    - Method for tracking date/time/amount/category of daily transactions.
    - Budget management, with the ability to set various budgets, and automatically tracks how much of the budget is used up based on transaction categories. Also reports how much under budget I am and average daily cost compared to budgets for things like daily eating cost.
    - Preview/what-if check ability for seeing how a possible future expense would change my balances after budgets are taken into account. Useful for seeing how much I'll have after a paycheck arrives in my bank account but maybe it just hasn't arrived yet, or for credit transactions that don't occur same moment/day of actual purchase.
    - Recurring bill tracker, tracks my existing bills and income, provides a table with indication of whether or not those items have occured for the current month (checks or bill payment) and shows total bill/income amounts for the month.
    - Provide pie charts for easy visualization of what proportions my expenses are compared to each other. Great for measuring if I buy too much candy/electronics and what specifically I can cut back on.
    - Provide timesheet that ties into monthly income to connect hours worked to actual paycheck amount for the month, and to show a pay/period progress report for hours. Nice for making sure I don't go over hours and seeing how close I am to finishing the weeks hours.
    - Provide method for entering my raw bank amount to check how much costs are missing from record, and also provides a month start amount. These help with figuring out what expenses I may have forgotten to enter into the system.
    - Provide a method for tracking lost costs using an "offset" cost category.

IMPROVEMENT:
    - Create an archiving function to handle switching from one months records to the next.
