Initializing SD card...No card detected. Waiting for card.
Initialization done.
demoFile.txt doesn't exist. Creating.
Opening file: demoFile.txt
Enter text to be written to file. 'EOF' will terminate writing.
this is a test of the micro sd logging board
I wonder if the only newline characters that will exist are the ones

will there be newlines at the end of the 20 char buffer empty?
eof
EOF
